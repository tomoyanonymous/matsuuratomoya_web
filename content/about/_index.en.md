Sound Maker/Engineer/Designer/Programmer

I make sound artworks, electric musical instruments, systems for live performance and also composing, playing and so on.

A strong interest in making works is "System" in varying media around sound, in particular, the relationship between "Liveness/Communication" and "Archive/Record/Memory".


In addition, I also develop sound systems/program for installation art works as a technical support, recording, sound design of animation, theatre sound design/SR and so on.
