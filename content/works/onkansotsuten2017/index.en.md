I organized Graduation Exhibition of Senju Campus, Tokyo University of the Arts.
Also did a coding for a website.

I produced students interview sessions published on website. I also invited guest commentator, Satoru Wono and Kazuhiro Jo and hosted critique session-tours for visitors.

I also presented my work [送れ|遅れ/post|past](/works/post-past_sotsuten).
