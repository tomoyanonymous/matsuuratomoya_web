An utility application to measure Impulse Response, an useful data to sample a reverbration and head-related transfer function. Purely implemented on Cycling'74 Max, no need to install external tools.

This can generate a test signal based on Angelo Farina's Exponential Sine Sweep method, record audio signals and convert recorded signals into impulse responses without any other tools(currently up to 4 tracks).
