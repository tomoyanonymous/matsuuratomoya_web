3 musicians, they are making somthing like electronic music but no specific genre can be appied.

The Blue of the traffic signal is actually Green, it is often said in Japan. From worldwide view, the border between green and blue is very different by the cultural background. There is the word of "Grue", the vague color between green and blue. By the way, today's electronic music is too varying to divide into genres, one is from the classical electronic music, the other is from the dance music,,, What s/he is listening in front of same stage may completely different from what I listening by his/her musical background. However the musics which are difficult to fits some specific genre, stuff into one place, they may become somewhat cool or interesting.

My performance in June was with no computer, in October was partially computer. So in this live, I'll do with  only computer.
