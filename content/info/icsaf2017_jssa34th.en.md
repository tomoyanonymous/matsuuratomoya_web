I'll exhibit my work "Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument" at Inter College Sonic Arts Festival(ICSAF) in 2017/12/16,17.

<http://ic.jssa.info#en>

On that time, I'll also do a presentation about this work, with the title "『Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument』―A sound Installation rethink about sound and music from the view of a modeling― " (Presentation will be only in Japanese,sorry.)

#### 『Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument』―A sound Installation rethink about sound and music from the view of a modeling― (Artist’s Note)

Matsuura Tomoya, Jo Kazuhiro(Kyushu University Graduate School of Design)

In this paper,I will explain about my work "Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument", the motive and its structure. After that, I will compare to related works from the point of view of "Feedback" concept and consider about physical modeling as a one of the form to describe sound and music.  "Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument" is a sound installation based on the physical modeling. In this work, physical modeling, which is generally used as imitate the structure or the timbre of an actual instrument in a computer, is constituted with physical objects in the actual space. I re-implemented the "Whirlwind", which is virtual instrument by Cook et al. with acoustic resonator ,delay with acoustic wave propagation and such a physical elements. Next, I will consider about Larsen Effect which used consequently in the work from the view of Feedback and compare to other related works in a field of the composition, sound installation and the performance. Based on them, I will present a modeling itself as a one form to describe the sound and the music. In that way, building and realizing the model is compared to composition and playing the notation/score as  one possibility of physical modeling outside of the computer.
