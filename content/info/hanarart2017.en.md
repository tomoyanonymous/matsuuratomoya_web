# (Arch | L)ive #1 Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument

## Statement

In a synthesizer, there is the way of "Physical modeling synthesis" that imitates the timber of a real musical instruments by numarical computation.
In early works of that, there was "Whirlwind", the abstract model of the wind instruments which has no targets to imitate.

In this work, I'll reconstruct Whirlwind with physical components, Microphone, Speaker or electric parts, deform it to be adapted into environments and codify into numerical model again, and repeat them.

Rethink Transmission/Record/Play/Compose from a perspective of Instrument and Model.
