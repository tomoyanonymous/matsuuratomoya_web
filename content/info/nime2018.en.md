It's my first international conference, english paper and reviewed paper. I am looking forward to receiving many feedbacks.

The work Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument has already exhibited 3 times. I was trying to exhibit the same work repeatedly with changing an implementation adapted to environments, however, I am considering that the exhibition in NIME is a final time to step into making a new works, for now.
