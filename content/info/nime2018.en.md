2018/06/03~06/08までアメリカのバージニア工科大学で開催されている国際学会NIME（New Interface for Musical Expression）で作品「Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument」の展示を行います。

I will attend  International Conference NIME(New Interface for Musical Expression) 2018. Also exhibit my latest installation work "Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument" and do a poster presentation about the work.

自分にとってははじめての国際学会、英語論文、査読付き論文でまず通ったことが一つ良かったことなのですが、発表自体も気合を入れていきたいところです。

It's my first international conference, english paper and reviewed paper. I am looking forward to receiving many feedbacks.

The work Aphysical Unmodeling Instrument has already exhibited 3 times. I was trying to exhibit the same work repeatedly with changing an implementation adapted to environments, however, I am considering that the exhibition in NIME is a final time to step into making a new works, for now.
